question: |
  Massachusetts Eviction Defense
subquestion: |
  This interview is for tenants being evicted in Massachusetts.
  You should only complete this interview if you were given a summons and complaint
  and have a date to appear in court. 
  The interview will help you complete the forms you need to defend an eviction case.
  You will need to print and deliver a copy to the court and the attorney
  who represents your landlord. If your landlord doesn't have an attorney 
  you can bring a copy to your landlord.

  This is the "splash screen" for the interview.  The question is a
  multiple-choice question with one option.

  This example demonstrates that HTML can be combined with Markdown
  in the text of questions.  Here, we wanted to show a particular icon
  available in Bootstrap, so we inserted raw HTML.
